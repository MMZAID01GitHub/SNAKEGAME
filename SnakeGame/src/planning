you have a square
on arrowpress 
	while (another key isn't pressed)
		translate in direction arrowpress

food x,y random location
if (square x,y == food x,y)
	add new square following current square
	food x,y, new random location
	
	
	
How id design the squares for the snake:
	maybe like an arraylist of squares
	when food is eaten another square object is added to the list and 
	while(lastKey = left)
		square's x = previous square x + 1
	while(lastKey = right)
		square's x = previous square x - 1
	while(lastKey = up)
		square's y = previous square y -1
	while(lastKey = down)
		square's y = previous square y + 1
		
Squares would be Rectangle objects
